      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>I am a software engineer with a <strong>PhD</strong> and <strong>6+ years of experience in industry</strong>
        who is interested in writing quality code, learning new skills and applications for those skills, and solving
        people's problems. Most recently, I have been working primarily in Java (more specifically, Spring Boot
        microservices), though a large portion of my time is spent using supporting technologies, such as Docker,
        Ansible, Terraform, Gradle, and Bash, and integrating with technologies such as Apache Kafka, MongoDB, Redis,
        and PostgreSQL. While I enjoy all sorts of learning, I am particularly excited when I can pinpoint the
        ambiguities in specifications that can derail a project, or discover a tool or technique that can make work
        faster and more accurate.</p>

          <em><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>, July 2017 to present.</em><br />
          Primarily Java/Spring Boot, with heavy usage of supporting technologies, plus leadership, architectural,
          and mentoring activities. The umbrella project/product I have been responsible for is Computer Assisted
          Provider Documentation (CAPD) Services, a web service which connects a desktop client interacting with an
          Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, such as Epic or Cerner, with a real-time natural language
          processor, providing layers for security and feedback customization. Activities related to this have
          included:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Designing and Developing CAPD Data Services
              <ul>
                <li>A new set of microservices, the core of which uses Apache Kafka to gather and process large
                  amounts of data from our clients in real time, primarily for reporting purposes.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Adding support for Encounter-Based Reasoning
              <ul>
                <li>A major new feature connecting the real-time natural language processor with the results of
                  processing completed
                  documents from a customer EHR system</li>
                <li>Required new systems to manage user and identifier mappings, configuration and credential caching,
                  integration of JSON Web Tokens, fallback mechanisms, an additional API call for extended NLP evidence,
                  and improved metrics, monitoring, and logging.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Implementing the Notereader CDI Interface
              <ul>
                <li>An intercompany project connecting 3M/M*Modal's NLP with Epic to provide near real-time
                  encounter-based reasoning directly in the EMR., storing and incorporating feedback from providers.
                </li>
                <li>Stores provider feedback, using that feedback in determining subsequent responses (Spring Data
                  JPA/Hibernate)
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Migration to AWS
              <ul>
                <li>This involved the creation of a library of Terraform and Ansible scripts that allows our
                  services to be deployed across multiple environments consistently.</li>
                  <li>Implemented new security requirements (customer data segregation, TLS between microservices)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Improvements to build scripts
              <ul>
                <li>Incorporated Ansible configuration generation into a Gradle plugin to maintain consistency between local development and other environments, and to reduce risk of password exposure.</li>
                <li>Incorporated local dockerized Mongo and Postgres databases, speeding up application startup during development by about 4x.</li>
              </ul>
