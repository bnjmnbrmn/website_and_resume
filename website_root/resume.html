                <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
                <p>
                    I am a software engineer with a Computer Science Ph.D. and 9+ years of experience in industry. I
                    have spent the past ~7 years working on microservices systems related to large-scale creation,
                    analysis, storage, and retrieval of medical information. I would be happy to continue in
                    healthcare technology, but I am open to working in other areas with similar challenges, especially
                    where I can help people raise the bar on software quality.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Distributed systems are notoriously difficult to get right. One reason for this is that our
                    traditional single-threaded unit tests do not catch problems related to network constraints and
                    concurrency. We also sometimes make developing distributed systems more difficult by delegating a)
                    deployment and configuration to a separate Ops team and b) E2E+performance testing to a separate QA
                    team, typically late in our development process. My experience with these systems has made me
                    particularly interested in broadly-scoped tests that tackle non-determinism, observability, automated deployment as
                    a way to tighten/remove debugging cycles, and bridging gaps between teams.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Testing is not the only tool in our belt for making systems that work well, though--our ability
                    to read and understand code (and requirements) is essential. Disambiguating concepts, finding
                    accurate identifiers, and judiciously applying functional programming techniques are examples of
                    valuable activities from which I get a lot of satisfaction. I also enjoy working with
                    junior colleagues to help them write better code and use their editing tools more effectively.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although I currently consider Java+Spring Boot microservices to be my "bread and butter", I greatly
                    enjoy learning new technologies as the need arises. I am particularly fond of Scala, for instance
                    (though I want to emphasize that it is not appropriate for every job). I am also always eager for
                    opportunities to continue growing my experience in architecture and data engineering.
