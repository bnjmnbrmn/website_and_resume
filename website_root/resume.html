      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>I am a software engineer with a <strong>PhD</strong> and <strong>9+ years of experience in industry</strong>.  I continue to be interested applying my skills in writing quality code, learning new skills and systems, digging into the causes of bugs, and finding the best solution for the situation.</p>
      <p>Most recently, I have been working primarily on Java/Spring Boot microservices, though a large portion of my time is actually spent using and/or debugging supporting technologies, such as Bash, Docker+Kubernetes, AWS, Git+Gitlab CI/CD, Maven+Gradle, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, MySQL, JavaScript+TypeScript, RabbitMQ, and Ruby+Rails.  Somewhat less recently, I have also extensivly used Ansible, Terraform, Kafka, MongoDB, Redis, and Scala.</p>
