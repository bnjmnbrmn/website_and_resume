      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>I am a software engineer with a <strong>PhD</strong> and <strong>9+ years of experience in industry</strong>.  I continue to love writing new high-quality code, debugging and improving existing code, learning new skills and systems, helping my colleagues and our customers, and finding the right solution for the situation.</p>
      <p>General problems I've enjoyed solving relate to <strong>microservices</strong>, <strong>REST APIs</strong>, <strong>streaming data</strong>, <strong>data storage</strong> (sharding, transactions, high availability, SQL and NoSQL), reliable and repeatable <strong>deployment</strong> with zero downtime, <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong> (IaC, provisioning, AWS, cost tradeoffs), <strong>performance</strong> (latency, throughput/bandwidth, resource consumption, parallelization), <strong>reliability</strong> (logging, monitoring, testing, configuration minimization, code readability, redundancy, debugging of concurrency and memory issues), <strong>security</strong> (authorization, authentication, encryption, availability, integrity), <strong>DevOps</strong> (automation, continuous integration, containerization), <strong>communication</strong> (technical and semi-technical presentations, documentation, multi-team coordination) and <strong>developer productivity</strong> (build speed, build tools, local environment setup, mentoring, knowledge sharing).</p>
<!--      <p>Some specific technologies I've used professionally include Java, Spring Boot, Kafka and Kafka Streams, Scala, Bash, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Git, Gitlab CI/CD, Maven, Gradle, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, MySQL, OAuth, JavaScript, TypeScript, Ruby, Ansible, Terraform, MongoDB, and Redis.</p>-->

        <div class="job-subsection">
          <em><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>, February 2022 to April 2024</em><br />
          Engineer on the Alexandria Charts medical records platform team. The main challenge in this position was the <strong>wide range</strong> of applications/services to be upgraded, improved, and debugged. Highlights from my time here included:
          <ul>
            <li>Using Java reactive streams to improve document download speeds by more than 3x</li>
            <li>Debugging our CI/CD pipeline to significantly improve job completion times (e.g. 8x)</li>
            <li>A (WIP) system leveraging docker containers to greatly simplify deployment for new customers</li>
          </ul>

<!--<p>-->
<!--Applications/microservices included: "Document Viewer", a web app supporting searching patients' medical records across multiple EMR sources, viewing the highlighted results in multiple formats, and downloading the records in bulk; "Identity Reconciliation Tool", a web app allowing medical documents from multiple EMRs to be linked to the same patient; "Bulk Extraction", a tool for downloading zip files of medical records, based on searches (I improved performance by more than 3x); "Governor", a tool for appropriately transferring medical records between tenants; and "Indexing Service", a frontend for Elasticsearch, providing a domain specific language for searches (work included a major upgrade from Elasticsearch 7 to 8 in Kubernetes/EKS)-->
<!--<p>-->
<!--Technologies used in these projects included: Java, Spring Boot, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (Secrets Manager, EKS, Parameter Store, S3, Cognito, RDS, SQS), Bash, Elasticsearch, PostgreSQL, MySQL, OAuth, JavaScript, AngularJS, TypeScript, Angular, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, OAuth, Azure AD/Entra, Git, Gitlab, Gitlab CI/CD, REST, RabbitMQ, Postman, newman, treetop parsing DSL.-->

          <em><strong>Senior Software Engineer</strong>, July 2017 to February 2022</em><br />
          Primarily Java/Spring Boot, with heavy usage of supporting technologies, plus leadership (included time as <strong>tech lead</strong>), architectural,
          and mentoring activities. The umbrella project/product I was responsible for was Computer Assisted
          Provider Documentation (CAPD) Services, a web service which connected a desktop client interacting with an
          Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, such as Epic or Cerner, with a real-time natural language
          processor, providing layers for security and feedback customization. Activities related to this included:

                <li>Worked across teams (desktop application developers generating data, reporting application developers displaying processed data, batch ETL maintainers, and product) in a high pressure situation to resolve critical ambiguities:

                      User facing alert resolutions -- what state transitions count? How should they be debounced?
