                <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
                <p>I am a software engineer with a PhD and 9+ years of experience in
                    industry who likes creating <strong>high-quality</strong> systems. Problems I am interested in
                    often relate to <strong>correctness</strong> (disambiguating
                    requirements, naming things, code readability, identifying variants/invariants/preconditions,
                    functional programming), <strong>reliability</strong> and recoverability (logging, monitoring,
                    testing, configuration minimization, redundancy, concurrency and memory issues), <strong>data
                        storage and retrieval</strong> (sharding, transactions, high availability, SQL and NoSQL),
                    <strong>streaming data</strong> (reactive programming, serialization/deserialization, joining,
                    aggregation, retention, partitioning), reliable and repeatable <strong>deployment</strong> with zero
                    downtime, <strong>cloud infrastructure</strong> (IaC, provisioning, AWS, cost tradeoffs), <strong>performance</strong>
                    (latency, throughput/bandwidth, resource consumption, parallelization), <strong>security</strong>
                    (authorization, authentication, confidentiality and encryption, availability, integrity,
                    vulnerability detection and remediation), <strong>devops</strong> (automation, continuous
                    integration, containerization), <strong>usability</strong> (understanding stakeholders,
                    learnability, workflow efficiency), <strong>communication</strong> (technical and semi-technical
                    presentations, documentation, multi-team coordination) and <strong>developer productivity</strong>
                    (build speed, build tools, editing/refactoring tools, local environment setup, mentoring, knowledge
                    sharing). I also enjoy writing lists.
